I planned to start at the Wisconsin border and follow the Superior Hiking Trail home on foot, a hike of roughly 44 miles.

As an additional challenge, two days before the hike, [I ran 34 miles with 4,800 ft gain](https://mark.grindy.net/running/2022/05/21/race-recap-ss-50k.html). My quads hurt; both of my big toes were bruised; but I wasn't injured, and there's nothing like a walk to loosen things up...

Regardless, I decided that if I feel a certain kind of pain (especially in my right foot and ankle, which have been more injury prone over the years), I will call it a day and get a ride home.

# Goals

I hoped to complete the 45-mile hike in 15 hours, starting around 0600h, maintaining an average moving speed of 3 mph, and finishing by 2100h.

# Weather

Looked pretty great:
* Partly cloudy.
* Temp: 38-59 °F
* Wind: 4-8 mph (gusting 15 mph in Duluth midday)
* Precip: Chance of rain in Duluth 1-2pm.

# Recap

I started at 0630h and hiked until 1900, for 35.5 miles at 3.0 mph over 12h moving time with 30m stopped time.

Even though I didn't make it all the way home, this hike turned out as well as hoped. I got a good feel for what it's like to walk 20, then 25, then 30, then 35 miles. Sure, I didn't have my full pack on. But:
* the miles in my legs from Saturday's race ensured I'd get good sense of what it means to hike on tired legs; and
* also thanks to the race, the hiker hunger set in early, giving me a chance to understand what tastes good—and what doesn't—in the later stages of a longer effort... important because hiking burns more fat, whereas running burns more carbs, creating different cravings.

Interestingly, I failed to maintain what I thought was my "all-day" pace all day. For instance:
* Segment 1/2: Wis. border to Beck's Rd: 2283+2247 ft / 21.74 mi = 208 ft/mi => 7h08m, 3.0 mph.
* Segment 2/2: Beck's Rd to Piedmont: 2054+1699 ft / 12.12 mi = 181 ft/mi => 5h14m, 2.3 mph.

In other words, I moved slower during the final third of the hike, even though I had less vertical change to deal with. Of course, I'm OK with calling 20 miles a good day. But still, I'd sure rather hike 2.7 mph from dawn to dusk (and rest overnight) than 3.0 mph from dawn to noon (and need to rest all afternoon and overnight). Something to pay attention going forward, because it's likely that I'll feel good in the morning.

<a name="haiku"></a>On this day, the first 19 miles flew by. After the first mile, I stripped off my microfleece. As the sun rose, I pulled my buff up over my neck and ears to keep the rays off my skin. I walked among chirping birds; I hummed Vampire Weekend; I even sang Vampire Weekend. And as I plowed through the mud, celebrating the spring melt, I chanted a haiku of my own creation:

```
Fallen snows long past
Flood away at last: summer
My old friend is back
```

When I looked at my watch, I was surprised by how far I'd come in 5h30m. In no time, Ely Peak would be behind me, and I'd keep trucking right through Spirit Mountain. Or so I thought.

![The view on the way up to Ely Peak.](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/AM-JKLWTQdSOajDZgSSDWnc3c2wwZ1PpGKrZmEG6LkrlC5MSPT8os9nuXU5vaICEnNkrRrMcVvSttDsc5d-O6n5HsNSY5RP5rG2iW_VDcX76t1v4_cnguaJbefRfhPb4w9D1hxykZPuMjTdqTFIew5ZYwgpDLw=w1190-h894-no?authuser=0)
_En route to Ely Peak. The view is better up higher, but this selfie spot was more convenient._

After Ely Peak, miles 23-27 turned into a slog, despite how much I love this part of the trail. I'd run this section as part of the Wild Duluth 50k the previous October, and I'd forgotten how long it takes to get to Sprit. Not too much climbing. No steep descents. Good for rolling along at a good clip.

But 20 miles in—or 54 in the last three days—I had lost the pep in my step. I regularly glanced down at my watch only to realize that just 5 minutes and a quarter mile had gone by.

After Spirit, I followed the Wild Duluth racecourse down the other side of Knowlton Creek, forgetting that the SHT stays at the higher altitude. Oops. I backtracked uphill. Silly navigation errors like this become more annoying the further into the day you get. Fortunately, I had signed up for such a long day that the deviation and correction didn't really register. I looked at my current pace—2.4 mph, not as fast as my early miles—and guessed I'd make it home around 2300h.

Soon enough, Sarah called on her way home from work. She and mom had made a plan for mom to drop Sarah off, so she could hike with me. Mom would then drive ahead to the next trailhead, where dad would be waiting in their car, and they would hike back toward us. I checked the map and suggested they meet me at the Skyline trailhead; they beat me there by a few minutes.

Hiking with Sarah gave me a huge boost, and not just because she brought me a burrito and a cookie. As we crossed the bridge over Keene Creek, turned upstream, and hiked past the waterfall, she marveled aloud at the amazing weather the day had to offer, as well as the inherent beauty the trail offered up at every turn: "We live here!" What a place to call home.

_Yet another selfie, this time with a few pixels devoted to Enger Tower and the famous Lift Bridge. Let's call it a placeholder for one of Sarah's photos of the waterfall._

As we rounded the clifftop around Brewer Park, Sarah and I caught my parents taking in one of the many views on offer. It was good to see my dad up and moving around after a recent (planned) surgery. The exercise was clearly giving him energy rather than taxing him; I have no doubt he'll be back at his hobbies (in particular, volunteering as builder/plumber/handyman extraordinarre at YMCA Camp Miller).

As Sarah has often reminded me, my parents are so very good to me. They've been generous enablers of my silly hobbies. The hour and a half mom gave up this morning to drive me to the trailhead in Wisconsin... not to mention the morning AND afternoon she gave up to serve as my crew chief at the ultramarathon on Saturday... those are no exception. Love you, mom.

By the time the four of us got to the cars at the Haines Rd. trailhead, just before the Piedmont seciton, my legs were telling me it was a good time to hop in the car and get home to a hot shower. There will be many Sarah-less days on the hike north, and it felt important to take advantage of her evening off to be together—something we won't be able to do once I get north of home, further and further away.

When we got home, the theme of the evening was water usage. I started a load of laundry, washed the dirt off my legs, and poured a mug of hot tea. Meanwhile Sarah watered her plants, and we split a beer. Our cup runneth over.
