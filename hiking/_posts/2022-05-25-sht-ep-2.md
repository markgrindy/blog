On the heels of Saturday's ultra run and Monday's ultra hike, it felt important to make Tuesday a rest day.

Of course, the rest day had offered b-e-a-utiful weather. This day, however, promised a drizzle. Oh well.

# Goals

Given the weather, the goal was to hike easy, test my rain gear, and guage the state of my legs and feet.

# Weather

* Temp: 47-52 °F, with temps dropping all day.
* Precip: 0.25 in, between 0900h and 1500h.
* Wind: 20 mph E, gusting 35 mph.  
* Dew point: 41 °F, comfy.

# Gear

I used nearly the same gear as [Episode 1](/hiking/2022/05/23/sht-ep-1.html#gear).

Earlier, the nicer forecast had allowed me to carry denser rain gear. This time, I traded out the Solomon Bonatti rain jacket (waterproof-breathable fabric) for the Frogg Toggs poncho (waterproof non-breathable) I plan to bring all the way to Canada.

# Food

Ate loaded oatmeal for breakfast.

Given the shorter hike, I left my cold-soaking kit (jar and spoon) at home.

Snacks:
* 2x Spring Energy Canaberry (only ate one)
* 1x cashews
* 1x mango slices (did not eat these)
* 1x trail mix (did not eat these)

# Recap

I started at 0800h and hiked until 1200h, for 10.4 miles at 2.9 mph over 3h36m moving time with 12m stopped time.

Mom, bless her, dropped me at the Haines Rd. trailhead, where I left off yesterday. As I hiked through Piedmont, she drove around to the 24th Ave W trailhead and began walking south to meet me, so she could walk north with me.

I passed by two nice overlooks, thinking mom would have enjoyed them. When our paths crossed, she was coming uphill and had already decided that, rather than keep hiking to the overlook—her very favorite—she would turn around and hike with me. I suggested we head back uphill to the overlook, but she wanted nothing to do with that. Onward!

By them time we got to 24th Ave W, I had my poncho on and her wool sweater was dotted with drops. She said she'd pick me up later today if I decided to walk past home, but I'd decided the day before to call it at home.

This was to be a recovery day—as close to a rest day as it could be. I didn't start the day with any pep in my step, and I didn't force it. I hiked with little effort through the rain-free morning and the midday drizzle.

The hike's low point was Canal Park, and not just in terms of elevation. As I descended toward the lake and exited the tree cover, the wind and rain suddenly made their presence known. I stopped under a bridge to don my wind pants and microfleece, and pointed myself straight into the wind and the wet.

All day, while I walked, I had tried to come up with a haiku as cheery as [yesterday's](/hiking/2022/05/23/sht-ep-1.html#haiku). Well, I failed.

Today's hike-ku is a downer—a response to all the global- and national-level trauma, as well as that closer to home. For instance, the trail winds through the homeless encampment just uphill of the I-35 freeway crossing. As I passed by the rain-soaked tents and tarps and dwelled all day on the Uvalde parents who sent their kids to school and never got to see them come home, I felt grateful for the extreme safety and comfort I've enjoyed in my life—akin to a 34-year-long hug.

There is no cheery poem today.

```
Pain pain pain pain pain
Pain pain pain pain pain pain pain
Pain pain pain pain breathe
```

So, yeah. I feel helpless. The one thing I can do—have to do—in response isn't much of anything, but today it's all I've got.

_Lake Superior, Park Point, and a big ol' boat, as seen through the bunker windows of the Northland Vietnam Veterans Memorial._

Before turning uphill from the lakeshore, I paused inside the concrete bunker memorial—the Northland Vietnam Veterans Memorial—built on the lakeshore in honor of [136 service members](https://www.legion.org/memorials/235350/northland-vietnam-veterans-memorial) who called this place home but never made it home. Their names are engraved in a granite wall, not unlike the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, D.C. Opposite the wall, the sloping concrete bunker rises up from Lake Superior and hangs over you like a wave always about to crash down.

When I got home, I microwaved a frozen burrito, stared out the window, and longed for a hug from my wife.
