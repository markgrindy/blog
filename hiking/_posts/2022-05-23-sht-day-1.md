# Goals

I planned to start at the Wisconsin border and follow the Superior Hiking Trail home on foot, a hike of roughly 44 miles.

As an additional challenge, two days before the hike, [I ran 34 miles with 4,800 ft gain](https://mark.grindy.net/running/2022/05/21/race-recap-ss-50k.html). My quads hurt; both of my big toes were bruised; but I wasn't injured, and there's nothing like a walk to loosen things up...

Regardless, I decided that if I feel a certain kind of pain (especially in my right foot and ankle, which have been more injury prone over the years), I will call it a day and get a ride home.

Looked pretty great:
* Partly cloudy.
* Temp: 38-59 Â°F
