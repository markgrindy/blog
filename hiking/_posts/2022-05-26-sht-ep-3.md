It's time to head north from home.

The most pressing concern is my right big toe. After Saturday's race and Monday's hike, the fluid pressure was just too painful, and I had to pull the nail off to relieve it. That of course opened a wound that I need to keep a close eye on, with antibiotic ointment and regular dressing changes.

Normally, I'd just let air out all day for a few days while I worked in the office; that's not possible while hiking all day. I'll try to refrain from sharing photos of it.

# Goals

Another easy hike today. No need to rush out the door. Let's just make sure we have our meals ready for resupply and see how far we can get.

# Weather

Lovely.
