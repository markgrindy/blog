Nothing like trying to do a shakeout during a spring that has been pretty terrible for hiking.

Superior Spring race director John Storkamp described the odd weather we've been having, as he [contemplated](https://www.superiorspringtrailrace.com/2022-superior-spring-trail-race-update-an-extremely-snowy-winter-and-record-slow-spring-melt-could-impact-this-years-race/) altering the course in advance of the May 21 race date:

> The North Shore had an incredibly snowy Winter. Then, in the month of April we rarely saw temperatures get above the low 40’s, there was no shortage of overnight temperatures in the teens, most days were cloudy, and new snow continued to accumulate right up until the end of the month. As of today, there remains up to two feet of snow on the sections of the Superior Hiking Trail that the Superior Spring Trail Race uses.

I needed to acquire more experience with my three-season kit, but I didn't want to travel south to do it. Finally, temps started getting into the forties, and my excuse to procrastinate started to evaporate.

*Assembled hiking gear.*

After shakeout No 1—a quick hike with a food-less but otherwise loaded pack—I knew how well I could move with my 12-pound base weight. It's always nice to get hiking miles in, but I set out with different goals for this stint:

* Set up my tarp at least three times:
  * once using trees;
  * once using only poles; and
  * once as efficiently as possible.
* Practice foot care.
* Filter water.
* Boil water.

### 1130h  

Midday, I checked the forecast; sweet victory, a day with highs in the 40s.

*NWS*

With that in hand, I made my final gear selection for the bugless afternoon in front of me. I left my permethrin-treated clothing at home, packed about 1,500 calories, and selected a grubby old pair of shoes that I know are prone to giving me hotspots in weird areas.

I also made a rough route plan: 10mi on roads and XC ski trails via 3+ creeks and 2 ponds. I ended up encountering more ponds than planned...

*Snowy and wet conditions persist on the gravel road through Hartley.*

### 1300h

I hit the "trail" with 1L of empty water carrying capacity, ensuring I would have to use my water filtration system.

After a half hour of hiking I was already nice and parched. I drank less water than usual that morning, enjoyed a caffeinated coffee (not my usual), and had run hard at the Spirit Mtn. 10 mile NTMC race the day before. I grabbed water from a nicely flowing spot in Hartley, to be processed by filter caps in my 18 oz softflasks.

I'd hiked less than half an hour by the time I achieved a hotspot on my right heel, ahead of schedule, and promptly Executed foot care.

*Foot care keeps a body moving. Featuring the very sticky Leukotape P, cut with pocket knife scissors.*

### 1400h

I decided to set up camp in the middle of the XC ski trail. Part of me figured staying out of the woods would better adhere to leave no trace principles. Another part figured it was one of the few dry spots in the zip code.

I kept my gloves on while setting stakes and tying guylines, making the setup more challenging but saving my fingers from the cold. I opted to practice the entire process—from tarp to sleep system. I even stripped down, pulled on my sleeping clothes, and climbed into my bug nest and under my quilt.

I closed my eyes and imagined spending the night. I listened to the calls of nesting birds, the wind through the pines, and the rumble of my stomach. I opened my eyes, looked at my watch, and determined to learn how to set up my system more quickly.

I got out, packed up, and resumed hiking. After a minute of walking my legs started to sweat, and I realized I forgot to take off my sleeping bottoms. That’s when I decided to “camp” again soon, before somebody witnessed a crazed man waltzing around in long underwear.

*This will be my first trip relying on a tarp. Together, my Solo Tarp from Gossamer Gear and guylines weigh 232g.*

### 1500h

This time, I deliberaly spent even more time setting up the tarp—practicing which stakes to place first, and how to angle and tension them before moving on to the next step.

A fellow who must’ve been wondering what the hell some weirdo was doing setting up an A-frame on the one dry patch along the muddy ski trail stopped to chat. He moved on fairly quickly, probably because he didn’t want someone else to see him talking to the weirdo in his underwear.

I soon packed up and moved on myself, heading directly for the snowmelt-swollen Tischer Creek.

![Dipping a cup to gather water](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/AM-JKLWu9CIhmifJCHgJH_mIxG94n6ibezK_O3ZNKQt3L39AQKZ5dSFoS20KfnvfMfgSTfzKqfjsI71g6f1WsyUIiQ4cut41q9XNJkXEV2MJ-FV5gCpMCdKRt5wnpIVo7qO6IcuAynVgwz4C5agHqQYuImwq4w=w2360-h1770-no?authuser=0)
*I used a hard-sided cup—the cut-off bottom of a water bottle—fill the two 18 oz. softflasks attached to my straps.*

From Hartley, I walked along a busy road to St. Scholastica. I climbed the hill through the cemetery overlooking the campus and on to a trail through the woods.

Confident I'd see no one back here, I selected a dry, flat camp between two nicely-spaced trees. I expediently set up my shelter, boiled water for tea, hanged my food bang, and murdered my first mosquito of 2022.

I imagined sheltering under my tarp during a rainstorm. I packed up while sitting underneath it—made easier by having rigged it on trees, which are taller than my trekking poles.

Within a half hour of arriving at the campsite, I resumed hiking, noshed on mixed nuts and more dried mango, and arrived home at just after 1700h.

### TAKEAWAYS:

* Clothing:
  * Next shakeout: Practice doing laundry and wear-dry.
  * Next shakeout: Hike and set up shelter in the rain.
  * Shorts and light long-sleeve were the right kit for the conditions: temp low 40s, dew pt 30, no rain, rarely wind, very nearly zero bugs. I didn’t get sweaty and felt chilly only in the first few minutes after stopping.
  * Puffy jacket was my favorite item; during camp set-ups, it was first to go on and last to get repacked. Taking it off felt like saying good bye to a friend.
* Shelter:
  * Tarp with trees is faster and easier than trekking poles.  
  * Remember to take wind direction into account!
  * Might as well carry 8 stakes instead of 6.
  * Try longer guylines on the corners of the shorter side to enable more height.
  * Next shakeout: Sleep overnight.
* Kitchen:
  * Next shakeout: Make a hot meal.
  Hydration:
  * Next shakeout: Use Aquamira drops to purify 2L water
