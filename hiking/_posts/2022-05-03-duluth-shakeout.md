Notes from shakeout hike.

HOME
1130: Noshed on breakfast potatoes, beef sausage, spinach, egg bowl. Checked forecast; sweet victory, a day with highs in the 40s; I was not eager to set up my three-season shelter in the snow, and fortunately we got a good amount of melt in the last week or so. Revised gear selection; left permethrin treated clothing at home, selected a grubby old pair of shoes that I know are prone to giving me hotspots in weird areas, so I could practice foot care. Made a route plan and loaded it into Gaia: 10mi on roads and XC ski trails via 3+ creeks and 2 ponds, since the city has closed local hiking trails until they dry out :(  
1200: Started going through the shakeout checklist; printed a to-go copy.
1215: Went through full gear list and tossed stuff in my "to go" pile (see photo).
1230: Packed in 5:32.
1245: Journaled the above.

TRAILHEAD
1255: Hit the "trail" with 2,000 calories and 1L of empty water carrying capacity, ensuring I would have to use my water filtration system.
1335: Gathered water - flowing but shallow. I was nice and parched, after drinking less water than usual, enjoying a caffeinated coffee (not my usual), and running hard yesterday.
1340: Achieved hotspot on right heel ahead of schedule.
1345: Executed foot care.
1400: Resumed hiking.

CAMP 1
1410: Selected camp. Set-up shelter and sleep system while wearing gloves, got into sleeping clothes, climbed in, closed my eyes. Very slow! More practice.
1450: Packed and resumed hiking. Ate dried mango. After a minute of walking my legs started to sweat, and I realized I forgot to take off my sleeping bottoms. That’s when I decided to “camp” again soon, before somebody witnessed a crazed man waltzing around in long underwear.

CAMP 2
1505: Selected camp. Spent a half hour on the tarp with poles instead of trees. A fellow who must’ve been wondering what the hell some weirdo was doing setting up an A-frame on the one dry patch along the muddy ski trail stopped to chat. He moved on fairly quickly, probably because he didn’t want someone else to see him talked to a weirdo in his underwear.
1545: Packed and resumed hiking.
1555: Gathered water - flowing well.

CAMP 3
1600: Selected a dry, flat camp between two nicely spaced trees. Expediently set up my shelter, boiled water for tea, hanged my ursack, murdered my first mosquito of 2022, and pretended it was raining as I repacked while still under the tarp.
1635: Resumed hiking. Ate mixed nuts and more dried mango.
1710: Arrived at start.

TAKEAWAYS:
Clothing:
* Next shakeout: practice doing laundry and wear-dry.
* Next shakeout: hike and set up shelter in the rain.
* Shorts and light long-sleeve were the right kit for the conditions: temp low 40s, dew pt 30, no rain, rarely wind, very nearly zero bugs. I didn’t get sweaty and felt chilly only in the first few minutes after stopping.
* Puffy was my favorite item; during camp set-ups, it was first to go on and last to get repacked. Taking it off felt like saying good bye to a friend.
Shelter:
* Tarp setup with trees is faster and easier than trekking poles.  
* Remember to take wind direction into account!
* Might as well carry 8 stakes instead of 6.
* Next shakeout: sleep overnight.
Kitchen:
* Next shakeout: make a hot meal.
Hydration:
* Next shakeout: Purify 2L water.
