This week in running... 

### MON
[Hike](https://www.strava.com/activities/7192616742): 11h57m 35.6mi (3.0mph) 100bpm 5,846ft.

Mild pain around the knees. Normal soreness in the leg muscles. Walking up and downstairs: not fun. Drank tons yesterday but should have had even more water. Need to go for walk today. 

HRV was sympathetic. No idea why. Should be very para. Huh. 

### TUE
Rest day

Racing an ultra one day and hiking for 12 hours two days later made for some great lessons learned about what the body feels like late into a long effort?and what foods I crave/hate. 

All the little muscles in my feet felt worn out yesterday but feel good this morning. Still going to rest today. Feeling like sleep and food will help consolidate. And I have a bunch of things to take care of around the house. 

Weird HRV: 10/10 and balanced; I feel like 1/10 para. 

Lower legs got sunburned, I think. Or maybe my skin is just rebelling. 

### WED
