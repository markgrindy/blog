I was of course looking forward to a muddy out-and-back on the SHT. This was not to be, and we still had a blast.

# Goals

Initially, my goals were to execute a negative-split plan and a nutrition plan that would have me eating a lot more than I have in the past. A late snowmelt [scuppered](https://www.superiorspringtrailrace.com/2022-superior-spring-trail-race-conditions-update-3-this-years-race-will-utilize-an-alternate-course/) these plans.

The first reroute changed the course to a pretty flat route on U.S. Forest Service roads.
* This made negative-split planning easier: I would run no faster than 8:30 through Honeymoon Mountain at mile 17, and then attempt to find 7:15 pace for the final 13 miles (only 600’ gain and 1,400’ loss).
* For nutrition, I had a plan to get about 200 calories an hour. The day before the race, Plan B went out the window when race director John [discovered a compromised bridge](https://www.superiorspringtrailrace.com/2022-superior-spring-trail-race-update-4-plan-c-another-course-revision-but-the-race-is-still-on/) on the rerouted course.

The second reroute, Plan C, had us doing hill repeats (4.2 mi out and back with 600’ gain) on a forest service road that submitted below Carlton Peak. We were allowed to do as many laps as we wanted. Eight laps equaled about 33 miles, so that became my race.  
* In theory, the new structure—laps—would make it even easier to try the negative split. But I was no longer interested in watching my watch so closely. I’d happened to run easy-ish up a 700’ hill in Duluth on Thursday, so I had a rough idea of what it would feel like to run within myself on a course like this. I planned to go by feel, take it easy the first six uphills, roll the downhills, and see what I had left for the last two.
* For nutrition, the lap structure meant that I could pick up gels and water at the turnaround every 30-35 minutes. I planned to eat 180-calorie gels during the second and fourth laps and a 210-calorie gel during the sixth. And if my stomach could handle more, I would eat more.

# Preparation vs. Results  

According to Strava, I went into this race with roughly 84 percent of the fitness of my last 50k race: Wild Duluth in October 2021. There, I ran 30.6 mi w/ 4,415’ gain at 10:32 pace, capping a summer and fall of consistent running.

Given that today’s result was 34.3 mi w/ 4,859’ gain at 8:25 pace, it seems safe to say we’re getting stronger. Cooler temps and better nutrition execution certainly played a role. Less training might have left me more fresh. But above all, I think we’re just building fitness over time.

## Training

I’d had an ankle injury in mid-December followed by three weeks off… then a few weeks of biking… then a few weeks of biking, hiking, and light treadmill running. In March, my fitness and spirits got a welcome boost during our family vacation in Sedona, where each day I ran first thing, did a morning hike with the gang, napped in the afternoon, and ate well.

After that, I started a phase of easy running with strides twice a week—and no workouts. With the exception of three NMTC race efforts (30 min, 70 min, 28 min) and a long run with 90 min at marathon effort, I more or less carried easy+strides into race day.  

I’m happy with how well this worked out. Going forward, I will plan to recover and hike a lot, then resume easy+strides until we get a bit closer to the Moose Mountain marathon. I’ll likely add in workouts, including longer threshold efforts and a few weeks that include hard hill repeats just before the hiking trip that we will do in the weeks before race day.  

## Weather

Pretty much perfect running weather.

* Cloudy.
* Temp: 38-47 °F
* Wind: 5-12 mph
* Precip: 2% chance

It ended up drizzling off and on laps 4-8.

## Gear

Worn:
* Hoka Speedboat shoes
* Aonijie toe socks
* Lulu sport brief (grey)
* Patagonia strider shorts (blue) with the liner cut out
* sport shirt (green) with cut-off sleeves (to vent a good amount heat, but not as much as a singlet)
* arm warmers (glad to have for the first lap; unnecessary for the rest)
* buff (worn as headband)
* sunglasses

In reserve:
* LS shit, SS shirt, singlet, buff, wool headband, fleece hat
* rain jacket
* cycling cap (in case of sun, in nice to have a bill)
* foot-care & misc. (band aids, safety pin, caffeine pills, etc.)

I ended up being very pleased with my gear choices. I did not overheat on the uphills. And although I felt a chill on the downhills—especially when it was drizzling and gusting—I never got truly chilled.

Next time, I will remember to band-aid my nips before the start (I lost about 3 minutes applying them mid-race). I also learned a glove-related lesson.

Around lap 4 I got into a routine of pocketing my gloves before the turnaround at the bottom, and putting them back on just after the turnaround at the top. I wish I’d thought to do do this earlier in the race. On the second down, my hands got cold and I put my gloves on at the bottom, so, by the time I submitted lap three, my hands were wet with sweat, which made for a colder descent. Live and learn!

I attempted to dry out my gloves by putting the bottom half in my pocket and letting the fingers air out. Of course one fell out, and a very kind runner, John, picked it up, flagged me down, and handed it back off. I thanked John profusely and stuffed my gloves deep into my pockets. They dried out well enough while I was wearing them on the descent.

## Nutrition

* 250 mL soft flask (fits into shorts pocket when empty; carried water laps 2, 4, 6, 7)
* 18 oz soft flask with wrist strap (carried 300 mL of electrolytes lap 8).
* 180 cal Spring Energy Awesomesauce (laps 2, 4)
* 210 cal Spring Energy Koffee (attempted to consume lap 6; couldn’t get it down)
* amazing, salty potato chips (lap 7-8 turnaround).

My stomach ended up doing OK but still so much progress to make here. I’d like to be able to do 200+ cal/hr no problem.
* I had a great breakfast at 3:45 AM, probably 1,000+ calories between the 3rd Street Bakery almond croissant, plus loaded overnight oats with granola.
* The first gel went down fine, but I didn’t take it until 1:00 into the race, near the end of lap 2. Next time, I should try for 0:45.
* Around 1:30, part way down lap 3, I scanned my body. Everything seemed fine except my stomach, which really had no interest in taking anything more in. I decided a bathroom break might be a good investment, and I spent nearly 2 minutes in the port-a-potty between laps 3 and 4. Immediately, I felt better, but decided not to eat on the way uphill when I was working harder. I popped the next gel toward the end of lap 4 at about 2:00. Again, ideally I would have taken this at around 1:30.
* I think I’ve eaten my last mid-race Koffee gel. I wanted the caffeine, but the flavor just doesn’t suit me. I ate maybe half the gel on the way up lap 6, but I didn’t take any water with it, got fairly painful stomach cramps on the way down and powered through, believing that guzzling water at the turnaround would solve it. It did, but I failed to finish the gel and didn’t have interest in any more gels after that. Next time, I'll just eat gels I like and swallow a caffine caplet.
* During lap 7, I started craving salts, and wished that I’d brought an electrolyte drink instead of water. I resolved to stop for chips between laps 7 and 8, which I feel at least gave me a nice mental boost, even if I didn’t really have time to digest them before the finish.

Next time, I should have at least one handheld bottle ready with electrolyte solution (I lost about 3 minutes filling a bottle mid-race). I had a softflask in my running vest, in preparation for the Plan B course, but failed to dial-in my bottles for the Plan C laps—even though I knew I wouldn’t need the vest or the bottles in it.

I may look into getting in calories (and perhaps even caffine) via liquids. Almost certainly this will be a home recipe—honey water/tea/electrolyte mix—rather than a commercial product like Maurten.

## Crew

Mom arrived around lap 3-4. It was so fun to have her at the finish line. She brought a smile and seemed to being having fun. Despite the 30 minutes I took to do a lap, every single time I came around the corner to the finish she was there waiting for me. I was grateful for her help. Laps 4-6, I’d run toward the finish, yell my order, and grab water and gels as I ran back out. After lap 6, I stopped for 3 min to apply band-aids to my nips, which were at risk of getting chafed on the chilly, drizzly descents. Mom thought I needed the band-aids because I was already in extraordinary pain: “Oh, honey, I’m sorry!” I reassured her I was fine, and that this was just a prophylactic measure. After lap 7, I stopped for four minutes to eat chips and help her fill my handheld bottle with electrolyte solution.

# Prerace

I planned to sleep in the car. Around 2000h, I found a flat spot to park. Woke up at 0345h to pee and eat croissant, oats, and granola. Went back to sleep and woke up one minute before my 0600h alarm. A great sign! Drove to check in and picked up my bib: No. 110. Then it was time to suit up, drink a thermos of hot water, and try to squeeze out a poop (I was successful).

Sat next to Birbal on the bus ride to less-than-fully-disclosed start location, and we enjoyed chatting about the course changes, as well as the Superior races we’d done; he is a many-time veteran of the 50k, 50mi, and marathon.

Despite the hiccups, I had a good feeling about the race and planned to enjoy the mystery of it. The location of the course itself was almost a secret—mom and I speculated that John didn’t want runners and spectators parking nearby, to save the precious few spots available for volunteers. John had busses running all day between the start/finish line at an elementary school in Tofte and the massive parking lot near Caribou Highlands, where the race normally finishes.

In his last [pre-race note](https://www.superiorspringtrailrace.com/2022-superior-spring-trail-race-update-4-plan-c-another-course-revision-but-the-race-is-still-on/), John gave runners a few clues about the course:
* "approximate 2.1 mile (uphill / downhill) course (4.2 miles round trip) out of Tofte with an absolutely stunning view of Lake Superior at the top. There is about 600FT of elevation gain in the 2.1 mile uphill segment."
* We also knew that the the course wouldn’t touch the Superior Hiking Trail, given John's [earlier note](https://www.superiorspringtrailrace.com/2022-superior-spring-trail-race-conditions-update-3-this-years-race-will-utilize-an-alternate-course/).
* And of course there would need to be plenty of room for toilets and bus turnarounds—but not enough room for parking.

After poking around the map for a few minutes, it seemed like a certainty that we’d climb toward Carlton Peak—but not all the way up, since the only way to the summit is via the SHT. I noticed a forest service road headed toward a gravel pit, and it seemed likely that it would be our course. I couldn’t quite pick out the start location, though, and guessed it would be the Tofte Ranger Station. I was a few blocks off.

The course started at an elementary school and hopped on the Gitchi Gummi bike trail before turning onto Forrest Road past a gravel pit to a nice lookout at the base of the cliff at Carlton Peak. The view was, indeed, lovely, and I got eight chances to take it in—but I never made time to step toward the edge and actually look out. No time for that!

With the runners assembled at the start line, John delivered his briefing. That included thanking everyone for rolling with the course changes. He did well to remind us of the huge effort the volunteers put in to prepare Plan A, and then Plan B, and when that fell through, he asked the group if they'd rather cancel or figure out a Plan C. The answer was a resounding: Plan C. So, John pulled yet another all-nighter to make Plan C happen. Total mensch.

Just before he was going to start the countdown, John allowed a kind soul to grab the microphone out of his hand, in order to lead everyone in singing “for he’s a jolly good fellow.” This moment was absolutely a highlight of the day. I admit we did a terrible job of singing in unison, though to be fair the crowd was huge. We yelled “we love you John.” John got the mic back, made a sheepish face, and joked “well, that was the worst moment of my life.” Everyone laughed. And then we were off.

# The race

The pace out of the gate was far from brisk. It seemed even the folks at the front were committed to taking it easy, even though we had asphalt for the first half mile to cruise up. A group of four went up the road, and I immediately and happily let them go. I chugged along in a group of three, and it felt like everyone was running the first hill climb at an easy clip. By the top, I had let the two guys with me get a sizeable, 30-second gap. I was prioritizing stay relaxed.

I hit the turnaround in seventh place. I knew I wanted to roll the downhills all day long, and I got that party started right away by catching and then cruising by the two guys I had let go earlier. I never looked back, but I think I heard at least one of them working to keep up for a few minutes. By the bottom I had a nice gap, and I was able to grow it over the course of the day.

The folks who had signed up for the 50k all started together, and there was a peloton heading uphill and stretched across the trail for the leaders to squeeze past on the way down. After that, the 50k field was spread out.

The course quickly became crowded again as the 25K runners started while I was finishing my second lap. When I met this second peloton, it was headed uphill and fanned across the bike trail. As I ran town, I tried to make myself big and tall, and I tried to make eye contact with people coming at me to ensure they were going gave me enough room to squeeze by.

At some point the 12.5K Runners started, too, and the numbers on course peaked, but the 12.5K must’ve started while I was at the top, because the crowd seemed thin enough on my way to the bottom. The rest of the day was fairly straightforward, and we all got used to being surrounded by tons of people.

The positive aspect of the crowds was the feeling of it being a real community event. On a single out-and-back, we would have seen each other only once. Instead, all 1,000+ of the 50k, 25k, and 12.5k runners shared the same 2.1 mi stretch of trail. This meant I got to see and cheer on people like Jakob, Kaelyn, and Danielle twice a lap.

Adding to the community spirit, everyone was full of good vibes and eager to cheer each other on. Aside from my buddies, I got the most love from the 50k runners who were hot on my heels. The top ten was a good group of folks who were repeatedly seeing each other all day long. Camaraderie is the word that sums it up, and there was more of it to go around because all 1,000+ of us were sharing the same 2.1 mile stretch.

I came to recognize the faces of the guys in the top three. The leader, Brett, was crushing, and Matthew and Dimitri were strong. I got to say things like “nice work!” plenty of times, knowing I had no chance of catching them.
* I finished 25 minutes behind 3rd place—getting close to a full lap behind Brett.
* I finished 33 minutes behind 2nd—I very nearly got lapped by Matthew.
* I finished 54 minutes behind 1st—and I totally did get lapped by Brett on my way up lap 7. He cruised by and we exchanged encouragement. Brett had been super encouraging during the first laps when there were so few people out; as the race went on, I could tell he was getting more and more focused. [His splits](https://www.athlinks.com/event/44440/results/Event/1018935/Course/2249808/Bib/201) say it all: six laps between 6:47 and 6:54 pace, with two laps averaging 7:00 flat. So impressive.

At some point after starting lap 3-4, I noticed one of the guys who had been in fourth place coming at me from the other direction. But this time, instead of ahead of me, he was behind. I’d passed him, and it must have been while he was stopped at the aid station. The crowded trail made it so difficult to understand what place everyone was in. All I knew was that I was somewhere between 4th place and 6th, which was very exciting.

The first four laps felt mostly great. I felt like I was running within myself on the ups. On the downs, I concentrated on relaxing and letting my heart rate drop. Then it started to get hard.

Near the top of lap 6, I stopped running for the first time to hike the steepest section—maybe a tenth of a mile, and actually not that steep. The downhill and the miles in my legs were starting to take their toll.

Fortunately, the downhills still felt good. Unfortunately, my heart rate was no longer dropping back down. I wasn’t checking my watch very often, but if I’d had noticed I might have been able to do something about it—take it easier, breath deeper, relax more.

Instead, during laps 5-6 and part of 7 (mi 17-27), I averaged just under my threshold heart rate for about 130 minutes straight. This was the recipe for distress that I cooked up, and on laps 7-8, I ate it.  
* I hiked a lot more of the uphill on lap 7—not just the full quarter mile of the steepest section at the top, but also a tenth mile of a lesser ramp earlier in the climb.
* I’m happy to see that I at the very least, I maintained this on lap 8. I might have even walked slightly less by paying better attention to my exertion level, starting to hike earlier, and picking back up to a run earlier.

By lap 6, as best I could tell (but like I said, it was pretty much impossible to follow) it seemed likely that no one was getting closer to catching me. And the guys in front of me were only getting further away. My feeling was that if I just kept it up as best I could, I’d hold my position.

This made me feel empowered to spend extra minutes at the turnarounds to band-aid my nips and get electrolytes in to the bottle that I knew would be easier to carry. It cost me time, but I thought it would make me feel more comfortable while I was out there, which I hoped would help me maintain a good attitude and prevent me from hiking more than I needed to.
 In the end, I had 13 minutes on 5th place, Jake, who was battling it out with another Jake just 2 minutes behind him. My 4:48:20 was good enough for 4th place. Given how far ahead of me the strongmen were, 4th feels like better than I deserve, but I’ll absolutely take it.

Most of all, I’m psyched to have gone a longer distance at a faster pace over more vertical gain than I did in my last 50k. And it was a totally Joe to be able to have a ton of fun running for nearly 5 hours with a group of cheery souls full of encouragement for one another.

That’ll do it for these notes. The last word has to be thanks to John and the gang for everything they did to make Plan A, B, and finally C happen, to ensure this top-notch event didn’t have to skip a year. I agree with John  when he said that we’ll be talking about this one for years. The weirdness and the mystery only help make it more special. I’m glad and grateful to have been a part of it.
