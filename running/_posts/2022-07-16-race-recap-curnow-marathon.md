When a spot on the waitlist opened up, neighbor Dave gave me the heads up. I signed up on Monday, helped Lane mark the course on Friday, and by midday Saturday I had finished one of my favorite trail races.

# Goals

Lacking fitness and the desire to push, I set out to lay a brick in the training wall and return to running soon after. If all went well, I'd accomplish a few things:
1. put in a nice "easy" long (and, of course, hard) effort;
2. practice nutrition (in particular, drinking more calories);
3. try, once again, to negative split a thing (in other words, actually start slow this time).

# Preparation vs. Results  

Strava's "fitness & freshness" score suggested that I was roughly as fit as I was when I ran the [Superior Spring Trail Race](/running/2022/05/21/race-recap-ss-50k.html). Which is laughable. There, I ran on mostly gravel, totaling 34.3 mi with 4,859' gain at 8:25 pace.

Back then, I was doing easy runs at 7:30-ish pace with nice, high cadence around 175 spm. These days, it's been a struggle to hold 170.

Anyway, the Curnow terrain—rocks, roots, mud, river crossings, Jarrow's Beach, etc.—naturally makes for slower paces—despite less elevation overall. I figured the fastest I could average over the 3,369 ft of elevation gain would be around 9:10, and I wanted to start even slower than that.

In the end, I averaged 9:18 for the 26.85 mi. (That includes my quarter-mile detour at mile 14; the official results for the 26.6 mile course have me averaging 9:28.)

Anyway, I had a great time and got what I bargained for.

## Good, long effort

Check.

## Nutrition

I planned about 200 cal/hr:
* Hour 1: eat 180 calorie gel (Awesomesauce); drink 20 cal electrolyte mix.
* Hour 2: drink 200 cal (Roctane).
* Hour 3: eat 180; drink 20.
* Hour 4: drink 200.

I carried an 18oz softflask/handheld and a 250 mL softflask. When empty, both fit in my waist belt. At the start, the 18 oz just had Roctane powder (no water), ready to be filled at the mile 7 aid station. The 250 mL had electrolyte drink (Drip Drop).

I also started the race with 2x 180 cal Awesomesauce, 1x 100 cal Canaberry, and a baggie with another dose of Roctane for the 18 oz bottle.

I'm fine with what I ended up doing.
* Breakfast: And egg-bacon-potato burrito and a small portion of chocolate-chia-walnut-granola oatmeal, consumed 2.5 hours before race start. (Next time, make it 3.)
* Hour 1: I was still stuffed from breakfast. I drank the electrolytes and ate half the gel. (I stand by this decision.)
* Hour 2: I finished the gel at 1h30m. I filled my 18 oz with water+Roctane. I filled my 205 mL with water. I sipped water for a bit to wash down the gel, then switched to Roctane and finished it by the time I reached the next aid at 2h36m. I also downed a 180 cal gel just before pulling into the aid station, where I bumped into Jonas. It was nice to see a friendly face, and I too my time at aid—refilling the bottles in the same manner. Then all of a sudden, a group of four guys poured into the station; I turned and ran—and fortunately never saw them again. Leaving aid, I again focused on water to digest the gel.
* Hour 3: Around the 3-hour mark, I pocketed a half-full 250 mL flask of water and switched to Roctane. It was still going down OK, but the temp had come up even more, and drinking a hot sugary beverage was less than pleasant. I reached the next aid around 3h36m, and the superstars volunteers helped ice find its way into my bottle and under my hat.
* Hour 4: By the time I hit four hours, my stomach made it clear that my rate of warm-sugary-liquid calorie intake would need to slow dramatically. So dramatically, that I just unscrewed my bottle cap and dropped the sugar-water weight off the side of the trail. Figured if I can't drink it, no sense carrying it.

## Negative split

This went out the window pretty early. I ran more or less to plan in the first three miles—letting tons of people get ahead of me. But I hiked well, hit Jarrow's Beach ahead of my intended schedule, and used the beach section to pass a half-dozen folks.

Shortly after, I caught up to Lane on a downhill and we ran the runnable section to the next aid station. And I mean ran! Lane's low gear is... fast, and I did my best to hang on while he clipped smoothly along at 7:30 pace.

He'd creep ahead on the flats. Maybe I'd get closer on a steeper uphill, or catch all the way up to him on a downhill. But eventually the laws of the universe prevailed, and he ran out of sight.

At that point, I was feeling great, but I knew I'd probably hurt later. The negative-split plan had long gone out the window. Totally worth it to lay down some fast downhills early and then share a few miles with Lane.

## Training

I'd had just three weeks of training before signing up for the race. It's been a "back-to-sport situation" following a sinus infection that put me out of commission for two weeks after my [thru-hike of the Superior Hiking Trail](/hiking/2022/05/23/sht-ep-1.html).

I basically did weekdays of easy running, sometimes with strides, sometimes followed by David Roche's "mountain legs" routine. On weekends, I'd run on trail and/or focus more elevation gain.

Going forward I'll continue with easy+strides until my pace and cadence are back where they were before Superior Spring. From there, I'll may shift into something similar to a 10k training plan, or just add in a threshold workout during the week and hill repeats in mid-August.

## Weather

Humid. Warm.

* Sunny.
* Temp: 65-75°F
* Dew pt: 62-65°F
* Wind: negligible
* Precip: 4% chance

My clothes were soaked in sweat. Not a drop of it evaporated, I'm pretty sure.  

## Gear

No complaints:

* Hoka Speedgoat shoes
* Aonijie toe socks
* Lulu sport brief (grey)
* Patagonia strider shorts (orange) with the liner cut out
* Janji AFO racerback
* Topo designs ball cap
* Goodr sunglasses
* Aonijie waist belt
* band-aids for various wounds and nips
* small baggie with Squirrel's Nut Butter, bandaids, ibuprofen, and caffeine

Goodness, I should have left the sunglasses at home. I started with them on my head. When I went to put them on, after the sun came up, they were covered in dew, drops, fog, everything. Not one stitch of my clothing was dry, so they just stayed sad and wet in my pocket. Maybe I need to learn a trick for drying them out.

# Notes

I don't have much to add. The whole thing was easygoing and fun. Always great vibes with this group of runners. The course is tough, scenic, dynamic. The volunteers are amazing. So glad I managed to get in.
