This week in running...

### TUE
[Run](https://www.strava.com/activities/7163040508): 1h04m 8.4mi (7:42) 145bpm 643ft.



Easy with strides into the wind. Felt pretty sluggish. Going uphill at the end felt OK but not fast. 

### WED

Slept terribly. Up at 3:40. 

### THU

Stayed up a little late. Had wine and plenty of it. This morning, well, I definitely felt worse earlier this week, so should be good. Easy run with strides. Plan pacing and nutrition for Sat. 

### FRI
Rest day

### SAT
[Run](https://www.strava.com/activities/7180853513): 4h45m 34.3mi (8:25) 158bpm 4,859ft.

### SUN
Rest day

Mild pain around the knees. Normal soreness in the leg muscles. Walking up and downstairs: not fun. Drank tons yesterday but should have had even more water. Need to go for walk today. 

HRV was sympathetic. No idea why. Should be very para. Huh.
