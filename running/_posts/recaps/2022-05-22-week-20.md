This week in running...

Easy with strides into the wind. Felt pretty sluggish. Going uphill at the end felt OK but not fast.

Slept terribly. Up at 3:40.

Rest day

Stayed up a little late. Had an extra glass of wine. Definitely felt worse earlier this week, so should be good. Easy run with strides. Plan pacing and nutrition for Sat.
