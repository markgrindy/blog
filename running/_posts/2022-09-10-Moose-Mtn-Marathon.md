After last year's unintended detour, I came back to Moose Mountain in 2022 with higher hopes. 

# Goals 

In 2021, I finished in 4h41m after spending 20 minutes making my way off course and back on where I'd left off. Could I come back, and improve on the 4h20m I thought I deserved? 

The main obstacle I'd have to overcome would be a lack of training. The bulk of the final two weeks before race day would be spent on a family vacation that offered almost no opportunity for running. 

However, that same vacation also came with some upsides: we were going to hike the Tour du Mont Blanc—which offered more than 100 miles, 38,000 ft of elevation gain, and 43 hours of time on feet in 10 days. 

I anticipated arriving at the start line with suboptimal aerobic fitness but stronger legs. If I couldn't run, at least I could hike. 

Maybe this wouldn't be such a bad thing. The last six miles feature two big climbs. Last year, I didn't run a step of them. This year, maybe I could make up a bunch of time by just hiking them faster. 

This inspired my plan for the entire race: push every downhill, hike every uphill, and, no matter what others are doing, keep moving forward at my own pace.

I drafted this pacing strategy, which would have me finishing five minutes faster than the year before (excluding the detour): 

| Milestone |	Mile |	Cum Gain |	Avg Pace |	Est Arrival Time |
| --- | ----------- |
| Start |	 00.0 | | |	8:00:00 AM |
| Temperance | 8.5 |	870 |	9:00 |	9:16:41 AM |
| Sawbill |	13.0 |	1855 |	9:27 |	10:02:46 AM |
| Oberg	| 18.6 |	2580 |	9:49 |	11:02:35 AM |
| Finish | 25.7	| 3946	| 9:54	| 12:14:23 PM | 

# Preparation vs. Results  

It's time to stop trusting the Strava Fitness & Freshness curves, because apparantly I was only 88 perceent as fit as when I toed the line last year and ran 4h41m (or 4h21m without the detour, which would have been good enough for 10th place). 

This year, I arrived at Caribou Highlands in 4h10m. I'm happy with that. If I'd run the same time last year, I would have landed in 5th place. This year, it was good enough for 2nd. 

For the next training cycle, I want to incorporate more hills for strength—but running them!—alongside strides and threshold efforts. 

## Weather

Great weather. It felt more humid than the dew point implied it should, but I have no complaints. 

* Clear skies
* Precip: none 
* Temp: 54 °F
* Dew pt: 52°F
* Wind: 5-7 mph NW

## Gear

At start:
* Hoka Speedboat shoes
* Aonijie toe socks
* Lulu sport brief (grey)
* Patagonia strider shorts (orange) with the liner cut out
* Janji racerback (blue) 
* cycling cap (the short brim blocks sun as needed without getting in the way)
* band-aids for the nips 
* Squirrel's Nut Butter anti-chafe for the nethers and armpits 
* Aonijie waist belt (for carrying empty bottles) 

In reserve:
* Salomon S Lab vest 
* trekking poles 
* foot-care & misc. (band aids, anti-chafe, safety pin, lighter, caffeine pills, etc.)

Everything worked great. I quickly sweat through the Janji top but had no problems—I like this fabric in the heat. No changes for next race in similar conditions. 

## Nutrition

Breakfast 0445h: 
* 2x 3rd Street Bakery croissants 

Start 0800h: 
* 18 oz handheld soft flask with water and Rocktane (200 kcal)
* 100g mango (350 kcal) – did not end up eating any of this 
* another 18 oz handheld with just Rocktane powder, no water, stored in waist pack  

Aid #1: Temperance 0909h: 
* filled the second Rocktane flask with water (200 kcal) 
* stowed the empty flask in waist pack 

Aid #2: Sawbill 1002h: 
* handed to Sarah: waist pack with empty bottles 
* took from Sarah: 18 oz Rocktane (200 kcal) 

Aid #3: Oberg 1056h: 
* handed to Sarah: empty flask 
* took from Sarah: vest with... 
  *  500 mL Rocktane (200 kcal) 
  *  500 mL electrolyte mix (15 kcal) 

Finish: 1209h: 
* Classic Coke 
* iced latte 
* chili 
* delicious homemade sugary pretzel/m&m mix 
* vanilla Oreos 

Before, I've regularly experinced nausea when pushing 100+ kcal/hr. This was the first race in which I was able take down about 200 kcal per hour with almost no stomach issues. 

The most significant problem I ran into was general fatigue/slowdown, which hit at the halfway point. I immediately sucked down most of my electrolyte drink, so my body seemed to be craving that. I now realized I should have planned to drink more of it earlier, based on what I should have learned from past training notes. Take the [Superior Spring 50k 2022](/running/2022/05/21/race-recap-ss-50k.html): Roughly 25 miles in, I started craving electrolytes; in retrospect, I probably shuold have consumed more of them starting at mile 15, even though the temps were much cooler than at the fall marathon.

If I could go back and do this race again, I'd give myself the vest (with 500 mL Rocktane and 500 mL electrolytes) one aid station earlier, and take filled flasks from Sarah at the Oberg aid station. I believe this would have kept me feeling stronger for longer into the race. And as a general matter, no matter the codititions, I should try to keep the dose Rocktane steady while increasing the amount of water+electrolytes. 

## Crew

My wife Sarah crewed me like a total pro. She woke up hours earlier than she'd prefer, drove me an hour to the start, and perched herself exactly where we'd discussed at each aid station. Smoothest race yet. No doubt we shaved several minutes off what I could have done solo. 

# Prerace

Sarah and I aimed to arrive at the start around 0720h, and I believe we got in early around 0700h. Hundred-mile runners were making their way through the trail near the start, and it is always humbling to see them—often with their pacers—continuing to push throuh the 23 and 24th hours of their own race with a marathon still left to go. 

In between cheering them on, I jogged a bit, tied and retied my shoes, went and rewent to the bathroom, and then got up toward the front as race director John Storkamp began his prerace briefing. 

Before the countdown, John expressed his gratitude to the 350 amazing volunteers who were making the run possible for the 350 of us lined up at the start. He said really nice, heartfelt things about the community, and I managed to yell "Love you, John!" during a pause. I wasn't the last to yell it. John said something along the lines of "I love you, too," and then we were off.

# The race

## Start 0.0 mi to Temperance 7.6 mi 

I planned to go out easy, knowing that I didn't have the aerobic fitness to push for very long. But something weird happened. Nobody pushed. I trotted off the start line at 7:30 pace and, suddently, I was all alone out front. 

This was very different from the year before, when an entire pack of guys shot out on the wide gravel road at 6:30 pace, in order to get sorted in advance of the single track that came up quick. 

The chase pack was maybe 30 feet behind me, and I heard a voice me say, "We'll see you later." Yawn. If they thought this was fast, I was sure they'd be behind me all day. 

I continued to trot along, alone, convinced the group would catch up to me within a few minutes. But they kept their distance. "What, am I radioactive?" I thought. I was hardly breathing, just enjoying the sestation of leading the race. A guy with a video camera started following me, collecting b-roll. I thought about all the live feeds I'd seen of guys on bikes or on foot, chasing after the leaders. But this time it was me! Going at 8:30 pace downhill on buffed-out singletrack. I was smiling the whole time. 

As the race unfolded over the rooty, rolling terrain, I kept jogging along. A few miles in, I heard a voice say something like "I'm going with him. I guess I'll see how far I can make it." Soon, I felt the thump of hooves behind me. The voice called out clearly as the hooves pounded effortlessly. I needed to know if I'd run this race before (and if so, what was my time), whether I had a goal time, and did I know that lots of people who ran under four hours were now well behind us? 

I wanted to say that if they thought they were going to run under four hours this year, they'd need to pick up the pace. Instead—thinking of last year's race when I was at best in the top ten at this point—I said that I'd hoped to be attached to the back of the lead group and was a bit surprisedd to find myself out front. I didn't have any goals. And the time I ran the race before, I went off course—so anyone following me should be careful. 

Following this exchange, the voice dropped its adversarial tone, became friendly, and introduced itself as Spencer. Turns out Spencer is a pretty nice guy, and I really enjoyed running with him. 

After a few miles of running the flats and downhills and hiking the ups as fast as I could (and successfully so—nobody passed me), I took my first glance back and noticed that a third runner had joined us. Soon after, the descent into the aid station came up, and I continued to execute my plan of running my speed—which mean bombing down the hill to the aid station. I came through with a small gap to Spencer and a larger one to third place. 

"I wish Sarah was here to see this!" I thought to myself as a kind volunteer filled my bottle and a nice crowd of volunteers and people crewing 100-mile runners cheered the first marathoners to come through Temperance. 

_Arrived 5 min ahead of schedule._

## Temperance 7.6 mi to Sawbill 13.0 mi 

I left the happy aid-station atmosphere alone, with Spencer maybe 30 ft behind. We enjoyed a mild descent along the west side of the river before crossing and heading back up the east side toward Carlton Peak, the first significant climb of the race. 

I seem to remembering reading somewhere that one running coach said of the Boston Marathon "The hills will find you out." But maybe I'm misremembering the quote, because when I plug that into Google, I get zero results. In any case, I expected to experience firsthand the notion that you can't hid on the hills. Fitness reveals itself... as does lack of fitness. 

It's here where my "hike the hills" plan went into full effect. I expected to lose the lead here, but even after second and third place caught up with me, they seemed content to let me lead. "Fine with me, as long as I'm going my pace," I thought. "Maybe Sarah will see me come through in first place!" And that's when I made the wrong turn. 

After about 800 feet of climbing, Spencer and I topped out at Carlton Peak. As we scrambled up the huge boulders that encircle the steep area around summit, we dropped second place. Just as we came around the far side of the peak, I missed an arrow and took a right turn. Spencer followed me. Fortunately, we hit another intersection almost immediately, with a sign pointing us to Ted Tofte overlook—and, crucially, zero orange flags marking the intersection. 

"This isn't right," I said, as Spencer pulled up behind me. 

"You sure?" 

I consulted my watch, which showed the track marking our progress had veered off the pre-loaded GPS course. "Yup, I think so." 

I ran back toward the intersection and saw the arrow I'd totally ignored. I yelled to Spencer: "It's definitely back this way!" I started up the trail, then turned back to make sure he took the turn. "Sorry, man," I said as we started the downhill. 

"No worries. You warned me!" 

Spencer also offered some nice words of thanks for pacing him. I knew better. "Happy to. You'll blow by me soon enough," I said, knowing he could have passed me on any of the uphills that I had been, still less than halfway through the race, hiking as steadily as I could manage. 

During our detour, second place had passed us by. "Maybe he'll push way too hard trying to catch us," I said, "and my screw up will have turned out to be an amazing tactic." 

"Ha! We'll catch him soon. He's not far ahead." 

_Arrived 1 min ahead of schedule (the detour cost only 2 mins; we ran 0:33 per mile slower than expected)._ 

## Sawbill 13.0 mi to Oberg 18.6 mi 

Spencer was right. When arrived at Sawbill aid just 1.5 mi later, the new leader——I believe it was Nathaniel—was just getting ready to leave. 

Over the encouragement of the volunteers, spectators, and other runners' crews, I heard Sarah calling my name. I grabbed my bottle, said "Thank you! Love you!" 

I was a few minutes ahead of schedule. Behind me, I heard someone say "Looks like you're going to make the wedding after all!" Sarah must have been making friends with some of the other folks waiting for their runners and told them about our plans for the day: wake up, drive north, run a trail marathon, drive south, shower, don dress clothes, drive further south, and dance all night at a dear friend's wedding. We figured if I finished the race on schedule, we'd make it to the wedding with about 20 minutes to spare. 

With that reminder ringing in my ears, I followed Nathaniel back into the woods. Spencer pulled up behind me as we began to climb a small knoll. Suddenly, I felt the need to dial it back and let my heartbeat come down. I immediately slowed to a hike. But Spencer wasn't having any more of this hiking business—not when he was now in third, and first place was still a few yards up the trail. 

"I won't see you again," I thought. We'd put time into Nathaniel earlier just by running my pace but never came close to shaking Spencer. A glimmer of the hope of reattaching myself to form a trio quickly faded from my vision. Even catching second place seemed out of the question as I slogged up the meager barely-inclined trail. I took a few big slugs of my sugary drink and recommitted to my plan: running and hiking my pace, whatever it was going to be. 

Soon enough, the descents were feeling great, and the sensation of flying down them (relative to my hiking pace anyway) lifted my spirits. Soon, I was running the flats again and jogging some of the milder uphills. 

As I wondered if I was doing enough to catch second, I kept glancing at my watch with increasing annoyance. The miles refused to tick by. The next aid station refused to appear. Here lies the easygoing part of the day. RIP.

I decided to follow through on my idea from the day before: to pick up hiking poles at Oberg and deploy them in the final stretch. It probably wouldn't help me get faster and catch the next guy, but maybe it could keep me from slowing down enough—keeping me in front of the guys behind me. 

"You're in third," I said to myself. "DE-FENCE!" But it didn't work out that way. 

_Arrived 6 mins ahead of schedule (apparently I was running better than I felt)._

## Oberg 18.6 mi to Finish 25.8 mi (6 min ahead of schedule) 

A tenth of a mile before I pulled in to Oberg, I heard the cheers greeting an arriving runner—not knowing if it was Nathaniel or a 100-miler. But just as when I pulled up to Sawbill, I saw Nathaniel filling bottles. Still, I put the sight of second place out of my mind and focused on getting through aid. 

Like the aid stations before it, Oberg was full of happy, encouraging people. As I passed the tables piled high with snacks, I waved to my friend Kaylaen who was volunteering. 

Then, once again, I heard Sarah calling my name through the din, holding up my vest and full flasks. I grabbed the goods and said "let's have the poles." And then I was off, with Nathaneil by my side. 

"I heard you took a wrong turn," Nathaniel said.  

"Yup, just a little sightseeing." 

I could tell immediately that Nathaniel was a lovely guy. We chatted briefly about the day, and he said he'd lost sight of Spencer on the downhills. 

Now, it was my turn to lose sight of someone. As we climbed around Oberg, less than a quarter mile from the aid station, Nathanial powered away from me. Mentally, I felt fine. Physically, there was something missing. At this point in a race, I've often felt nauseous and had trouble eating and drinking. This time, I started sucking on my electrolyte flask and, in a flash, two-thirds of it disappeared into my stomach. "Whoa," I thought. "That hit the spot." 

A mile or two went by, and I started to feel better and picked up the pace. I caught Nathaniel on the longer downhill from Leveaux; he graciously let me by, and I managed to quickly put some distance between us. 

I settled into the steep uphill that is Moose Mountain and, leaning into my poles, passed three different groups of Superior Hiking Trail backpackers in different states of sweaty discomfort. 

A downhill followed, and I didn't look back until I reached Mystery Mountain and did the only thing I could do up what should otherwise be a runnable incline: I walked my darn bestest (or as we like to say "power hiked"). 

Once I hit the top, with just 2 mi left and just 25 ft more of elevation gain, I folded up the poles and started running again. 

I whipped around a switchback and said hello to a backpacker. "Hello!" he said back and then, into his cell phone, "Oh, that was a runner." 

And on the final 25 ft uphill, I caught another 100-miler. "The next guy is just ahead of you. He was screaming by me. Go catch 'im." 

I laughed and said I'd do my best. "Congrgats!" I added. "See you at the finish." 

When we hit the road, the 100-miler stepped on the gas: "I'm coming for ya! You gonna let a 100-miler catch you?" 

"C'mon, you got this!" I yelled back. He was 50 ft or so behind me and closing the distance. My feet could hardly reach the gas pedal. I pressed microscopically harder, lifted the pace to 6:30, and bore down on the line—though I'm sure I looked like someone doing a pantomime of a sprint rather than an actual one. 

_Official time 4:10:35. Arrived 5 mins ahead of schedule, finishing 2nd._
